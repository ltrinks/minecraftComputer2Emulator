# minecraftComputer2Emulator
emulator for the computer I built in Minecraft version 2.1

In vanilla Minecraft 1.15.2 I made a computer using only redstone components in the game. I have designed my own architecture for the parts and my own machine
language interface. This respository will contain the files of the save file for the game, and a set of Java classes that when run emulate how the computer works.
